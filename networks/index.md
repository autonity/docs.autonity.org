Autonity provides open testnets for node operators, validators and developers.

## Get Auton test funds

To get started on either the Bakerloo or Piccadilly testnet, you can use the [Faucet](https://faucet.autonity.org/) to get free [auton](/concepts/protocol-assets/auton) to fund your account for testing.

If the Faucet is down for maintenance, an alternative way to get auton is by requesting some from the Autonity [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/autonity). Please note this will take much longer.
