  Autonity protocol parameters - definitions, genesis configuration, update mechanism if modifiable 
---

# Overview

The protocol parameters are the configuration variables for the Autonity Network blockchain and Autonity Protocol Contracts. The parameterisation sets how the network will function by specifying economic, consensus, temporal, and governance settings.

Protocol parameter values for [public Autonity networks](/reference/genesis/#public-autonity-network-configuration) are set as network presets in the genesis configuration of the Autonity software - i.e. the Autonity Go Client, Protocol Contracts, and Autonity Oracle Server.

Protocol parameter values for a [local Autonity network](/reference/genesis/#local-autonity-network-configuration) are specified in the [`config` object](/reference/genesis/#config-object) of the local network's `genesis.json` file. The local network operator can choose to use default settings or specify their own custom settings in their `genesis.json` file as required by their use case.

A subset of the protocol parameters may be updated by the network's governance account after genesis.

## Protocol Constants

Protocol Constants are protocol parameter constant values that may be used in one or more Protocol Contracts. They are defined in `ProtocolConstants.sol`.

| Parameter | Description | Genesis Configuration | Post Genesis Update Mechanism |
|-----------|-------------|-----------------------|-------------------------------|
| `SLASHING_RATE_DECIMALS` | The number of decimal points used for fixed-point arithmetic during computation of slashing penalties | `4` | None | 
| `SLASHING_RATE_SCALE_FACTOR` | The division precision used as the denominator when computing the slashing amount of a penalty | `10 ** SLASHING_RATE_DECIMALS` (`10^4 = 10_000`, i.e. 0.01%)| None |
| `CONVERSION_RATIO_DECIMALS` | The number of decimal points used for fixed-point arithmetic during computation of validator LNTN-NTN conversion ratio | `18` | None | 
| `CONVERSION_RATIO_SCALE_FACTOR` | The division precision used as the denominator when computing the LNTN-NTN conversion ratio of a validator | `10 ** CONVERSION_RATIO_DECIMALS` (`10^18 = 1_000_000_000_000_000_000`, i.e. 100%)| None |

::: {.callout-note title="Scale factor and decimals" collapse="false"}

Solidity doesn't natively support decimal fixed point arithmetic. Using the `DECIMALS` and `SCALE_FACTOR` method allows the protocol to define the % level of precision used when computing a value.

For example, `SLASHING_RATE_DECIMALS` and `SLASHING_RATE_SCALE_FACTOR` are used to allow for decimal slashing penalty values:

| Scale Factor | Slashing rate applied |
|:-------------|:----------------------|
| `10_000`     | 100% slash |
| `1_000`      | 10% slash |
| `100`        | 1% slash |
| `10`         | 0.1% slash |
| `1`          | 0.01% slash |

::: {.callout-note title="NTN supply, protocol schedules and Newton inflation" collapse="false"}

The _total supply_ of NTN is capped at 100M NTN, 60M of which is minted at genesis (`tokenMint`) and 40M of which is in the Newton inflation reserve (`initialInflationReserve`. NTN in the inflation reserve is then minted by the Newton [inflation mechanism](/glossary/#inflation-mechanism) and emitted into circulation over time as [inflation rewards](/glossary/#inflation-rewards) awarded to [participating](/glossary/#participation-rate) NTN. Participating NTN is the amount of NTN in the _circulating supply_ that has been [delegated](/glossary/#delegated) ([bonded](/glossary/#bond)) to validators and so is securing the network (at genesis this is `tokenBond`). NTN inflation rewards are emitted epoch end and [autobonded](/glossary/#autobond) to the validator staked to. Autobonding simultaneously increases the NTN [participating stake](/glossary/#participation-rate) amount of a delegator and increases network security.

The _circulating supply_ of NTN at genesis is the amount of NTN minted at genesis (`tokenMint`) minus the amount of NTN in the protocol schedules (`schedules`). 

The protocol `schedules` record the amount of minted NTN that is out of circulation at genesis. Specifically, the protocol schedules record the amount of NTN locked in locking contract(s) that will unlock and release NTN in to the _circulating supply_ over time according to an unlocking schedule. An unlocking schedule can be no greater than the `maxScheduleDuration`.

The amount of NTN in the circulating supply at genesis (i.e. `tokenMint` amount minus protocol `schedules` amount) is the _inflation base_ to which the _inflation rate_ is applied by the Newton _inflation mechanism_. The protocol schedules are properties of the inflation mechanism, therefore.
