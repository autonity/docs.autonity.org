  Setting genesis configuration for an Autonity Go Client
---

Genesis configuration for public Autonity networks is built into the client's configuration. If setting up a local testnet, for example a private devnet, configuration has to be specified when initialising the node.

## Public Autonity Network configuration
Configuring the client to join a public network is done by setting the network as a [command-line option](/reference/cli/#command-line-options) when initialising the Autonity Go Client. The client will then auto-detect the network genesis configuration and bootnodes, connect, and sync.

### Public network flags

|Network|Command-line option|Network settings|
|-------|-------------------|----------------|
|Bakerloo Testnet| [`--bakerloo` command-line option](/reference/cli/#command-line-options)| [Genesis configuration](/networks/testnet-bakerloo/#genesis-configuration) |
|Piccadilly Testnet| [`--piccadilly` command-line option](/reference/cli/#command-line-options) | [Genesis configuration](/networks/testnet-piccadilly/#genesis-configuration) |


For details of individual public network purpose and use see the [Networks](/networks/) section.

## Local Autonity Network configuration
For launching a local Autonity network, genesis configuration and bootnodes need to be specified when running the client:

- Genesis configuration file. To set genesis state of your local Autonity network you will need to provide your own custom `genesis.json` configuration file, a JSON formatted file containing the initialisation configuration for the network. This file defines:
  - the genesis block and that block's header
  - protocol parameters configuring protocol rules of the network
  - validators from which the genesis consensus committee will be selected
  - oracle network configuration
  - accounts to be created at network genesis: initial allocation of Auton to EOA accounts; contract accounts.
- Bootnodes. Bootnodes can be provided statically as a file or as a command-line option when running the client.  To provide statically, specify a `static-nodes.json` file, or as a comma-separated list in the `--bootnodes` command-line option.

| Parameter | Description | Value |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| `config` | Configuration variables for the Autonity Network blockchain | See [`config` object](#config-object) |
| `nonce` | Maintained by the Autonity Protocol for backward compatibility reasons in the EVM. | Set to `0` (`0x0` in hexadecimal) |
| `timestamp` | Specifies the time point when the network starts mining and the first block is mined. If set to `0` the node will start mining on deployment. If a future time point is specified, then miners will wait until `timestamp` + `blockPeriod` to begin mining. The local node consensus engine will start when its local Unix clock reaches the timestamp value. The Validator node operator must keep their local node in sync, i.e. by the [Network Time Protocol (NTP) <i class='fas fa-external-link-alt'></i>](https://www.nwtime.org/documentationandlinks/) | Set to `0` (`0x0`) to start node mining on connection to the Autonity network |
| `baseFee` | The base gas price for computing a transaction on an Autonity network after genesis. The base fee is adjusted per the [EIP 1559 <i class='fas fa-external-link-alt'></i>](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1559) fee market mechanism. See Concepts, [EIP 1559 Transaction fee mechanism (TFM)](/concepts/system-model/#eip-1559-transaction-fee-mechanism-tfm)| Set to: `15000000000` |
| `gasLimit` | The maximum amount of gas expenditure allowed for a block, placing a ceiling on transaction computations possible within a block. Denominated in [`ton`](/glossary/#ton). The gas limit determines the amount of gas allowed to compute the genesis block; for subsequent blocks the gas limit is algorithmically adjusted by protocol | Set to: `30000000` |
| `difficulty` | Derived from Ethereum where it sets the difficulty for Ethereum's Ethash Proof of Work consensus. For Autonity's implementation of Tendermint BFT Proof of Stake consensus this must be assigned `0`. | Set to `0` (`0x0`) |
| `coinbase` | Maintained for backward compatibility reasons in the EVM. Unused by the Autonity Protocol. Ethereum format address. | Set to `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000` |
| `number ` | A value equal to the number of ancestor blocks. At genesis there are no ancestor blocks and it is assigned the value `0` | Set to `0` (`0x0`) |
| `gasUsed` | The gas used in the computation of the block. At genesis this is assigned the value `0` | Set to `0` (`0x0`) |
| `parentHash` | A Keccak 256-bit hash of the parent block header. At genesis there is no parent block and this is assigned a zero value. | Set to `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000` |
| `mixHash` | Maintained by the Autonity Protocol for backward compatibility reasons in the EVM. Used for: (a) compatibility with 3rd party Ethereum tools that expect the field, (b) an internal code check by the Autonity Protocol before a block is accepted during consensus; blocks without this hash are rejected. | A 256-bit hash as a Hex encoded string, set to: `0x63746963616c2062797a616e74696e65206661756c7420746f6c6572616e6365` |
| `alloc` | An array of accounts to be assigned `Auton` on chain initialisation. Contract accounts for deployment at genesis can also be specified. | See [`alloc` object](#alloc-object) definition |


#### config object

|Parameter|Description|Value|

Introduced by [EIP 155 <i class='fas fa-external-link-alt'></i>](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-155) and used for transaction signature generation | 8-digit decimal integer value formed according to a naming scheme composed of 3 elements: `{A + Network Type + ID}`, where: `A` = `65`; `Network Type` = `00` (Public Mainnet) or `01` (Public General Purpose Testnet) or `10` (Public Special Purpose Testnet) or `11` (Private Internal Development Testnet); `ID` = `0000`-`9999` (unique identifier for the testnet).
