Interface usage and examples are shown using the Autonity Utility Tool ([aut](/account-holders/setup-aut/)).

Remote Procedure Call (RPC) that read state can also be done using [`curl` <i class='fas fa-external-link-alt'></i>](https://curl.haxx.se/download.html). You may already have `curl` installed on your system as it comes with many OS distributions.

A good helper for working with JSON response objects returned by RPC is [`jq` <i class='fas fa-external-link-alt'></i>](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/).
