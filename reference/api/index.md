#### Useful helpers for working with RPC
Interface usage and examples are shown using Autonity CLI ([`aut`](/account-holders/setup-aut/)).

Remote Procedure Call (RPC) that read state can also be done using [`curl`](https://curl.haxx.se/download.html). You may already have `curl` installed on your system as it comes with many OS distributions.

A good helper for working with JSON response objects returned by RPC is [`jq`](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/).
