## Command-line facilities

Command-line tools for interacting with an Autonity Go Client are provided by:

- Autonity Utility Tool `aut`. A Python command-line RPC client for Autonity. The tool provides access to Autonity Contract and ERC20 token contract interfaces.

For `aut` installation, usage, and command-line options see Reference [Setup the Autonity Utility Tool (aut)](/account-holders/setup-aut/).
