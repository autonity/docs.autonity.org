    "text": "Cross-margining in derivatives trading is not a new concept—many existing protocols already allow traders to share collateral across positions. However, in these systems, cross-margining is typically confined within a single trading venue, as both execution and clearing are tightly coupled within the same protocol.\nThe Autonity Futures Protocol (AFP) introduces a novel architecture that decouples trade execution from clearing. This separation enables a new and more powerful form of collateral efficiency: cross-venue cross-margining. Traders can now share collateral not just across positions, but across entirely separate trading venues.\nIn practical terms, this means that a position opened on Trading Protocol A can generate unrealised profits that are immediately usable as margin to support a new position on Trading Protocol B. This is possible because margin accounts (MAs) are native to the shared clearing layer, rather than being embedded within individual trading venues—removing the historical barrier to cross-venue margining.",

    "text": "The decentralized clearing system of the AFP is core to the current functioning of the futures markets that are built on top of it.\nExisting derivates markets (both in TradFi and DeFi) couple trade execution and clearing into one venue. In TradFi, monopolistic tendencies concentrate market activity into a single trading venue for a particular instrument, whilst in DeFi competition for market share in derivates with the same underlying results in a fragmented market structure.\nFor example, Binance, Bybit (CEXs), Hyperliquid and DYDX (DEXs) have all created BTCUSDT futures contracts, all built on the same underlying market: spot BTC-USDT. Yet, each venue that creates a futures contract on BTC-USDT allows for only their own product to be traded on their own venue, leading to fragmented liquidity even though the underlying is the same. This is not a decentralized market architecture.\nContrast this to true decentralized markets such as spot Bitcoin. Bitcoin can be bought on any CEX and if desired can then be moved to a wallet and sold on a DEX, providing traders with an abundance of liquidity options to trade it. The AFP introduces the same level of true decentralisation in the derivatives markets with its clearing system.\nDecentralized clearing decouples trade execution from clearing, allowing for trades to be executed at one venue but cleared at another. This subtle yet crucial architectural difference results in a significantly altered and more efficient market design, allowing:\n\nA rich choice of trading modalities to trade the same product\nTraders access to a global pool of open interest in a product\nCross-venue cross-margining",

    "text": "Any on-chain actor with an associated margin account can initiate the Final Settlement Process for a Product, once the product is in the FINAL_SETTLEMENT state. Such an on-chain actor is termed a “Closeout Agent”.\nA Closeout Agent initiates the Final Settlement Process by calling the\nClearing System’s initiateFinalSettlement(..) method with _Closeout\nData_. Closeout Data consists of an array of addresses denoting a set of MAs that (1) each have a non-zero position in the product and (2) collectively offset each other (i.e., the sum of their position sizes is 0).\nWhen a Closeout Agent calls initiateFinalSettlement(..), the Clearing System performs the Final Settlement Process Checks:\n\nFor each account in Closeout Data, fetch the account’s position quantity Q:\n\n\nif Q == 0, the checks fail and the processes is aborted.\nif Q =! 0, then increment checksum = checksum + Q.\n\n\nIf checksum == 0, proceed to the Final Settlement Closeout; if it does not, the checks fail and the process is aborted.\n\nFinal Settlement Closeout executes as follows:\n\nIf the FSP does not exist, call finalizeFsp and execute the Final Settlement Price Resolution per the process above. If that process fails, abort Final Settlement Closeout. If that process succeeds, continue.\nFor each account a in Closeout Data:\nConstruct a trade done at the FSP with a on the buy (sell) side and Treasury Account on the sell (buy) side if a’s position is short (long);\nApply trade settlement to a:\nRPnL = FSP * Q * POINT_VALUE - B\nC[t] = C[t-1] + RPnL\nQ[t] = Q[t-1] + -Q (i.e., Q[t] = 0)\nApply trade settlement to Treasury Account:\nUpdate Cost Basis B per conditional definition assuming a trade quantity of Q at price FSP.\nCalculate RPnL per conditional definition\nC[t] = C[t-1] + RPnL\nQ[t] = Q[t-1] + Q\nApply the Closeout Fee:\nC[t] = C[t-1] - CLOSEOUT_FEE_RATE * POINT_VALUE * FSP * abs(Q) on account a\nC[t] = C[t-1] + CLOSEOUT_FEE_RATE * POINT_VALUE * FSP * abs(Q) on Treasury Account\nApply the Closeout Agent Reward:\nC[t] = C[t-1] - CLOSEOUT_REWARD_RATE * POINT_VALUE * FSP * abs(Q) on Treasury Account\nC[t] = C[t-1] + CLOSEOUT_REWARD_RATE * POINT_VALUE * FSP * abs(Q) on Closeout Agent’s account\n\nThe product will transition from FINAL_SETTLEMENT state to EXPIRED state if the open interest in the product is zero; otherwise, the product remains in FINAL_SETTLEMENT state.\ninitiateFinalSettlement(..) can be called multiple times whilst the open interest is non-zero.\nNotes:\n\nCLOSEOUT_FEE_RATE &gt;= CLOSEOUT_REWARD_RATE\nCLOSEOUT_REWARD_RATE will be set at a level that’s a multiple of anticipated venue trading fees (perhaps 30bps) to incentivize users to close their positions before the conclusion of the Tradeout Interval.\nBecause checksum == 0, Treasury Account’s position in the product (typically 0) will be the same after the Final Settlement Process as it was right before the process commenced.

The clearing system does not enforce any particular trading modality, meaning that the same product could be traded on a Central Limit Order Book (e.g. Binance, Bybit, OKX), an Automatic Market Maker (e.g. Uniswap), a Frequent Batch Auction (e.g. CoW Swap), a Request-for-quote protocol (e.g. Airswap), or any other type of trading protocol the community wishes to deploy.\nTrading Protocol integration with the clearing system is also a permissionless process meaning that any trading protocol that wishes to make a market in a product can do so.

However, seeing as the AFP is a futures protocol, a margin account funded with collateral is first required to open any positions a trader wants to take on. Such Margin Accounts are native to the clearing system which allows them to be used across any trading protocol, allowing cross-margining not just between products in the same trading protocol (as is the current state of futures in TradFi and DeFi) but across all trading protocols. This means that the profits of a position opened in a CLOB trading protocol, could be used to fund another position a trader wants to open on an AMM in another product.\nAfter a trader has funded a Margin Account, they are ready to start trading.\nThe AFP uses intents to express a trader’s intention to place an order – meaning that if a trader wishes to go long Product A, they sign an intent and submit it to their desired trading protocol. When the order is filled and a trade occurs, the Trading Protocol sends this on-chain to the clearing system. The clearing system then performs verification checks on the submitted trade structure and ensures that the trade can clear.",

    "text": "The separation of trade execution and clearing in the Autonity Futures Protocol (AFP) introduces a fundamentally new market structure for derivatives. Traditionally, each trading protocol maintains its own siloed order book and liquidity pool for a given product, limiting traders to the open interest and counterparties available within that specific venue. In contrast, the AFP architecture allows traders to access the global pool of open interest for a product—regardless of which trading venue they’re using.\nThis is made possible by treating products as core primitives of the underlying clearing layer, rather than as constructs defined and managed by individual trading protocols. As a result, open interest in a product is aggregated and maintained at the clearing level, decoupled from any single execution venue. Multiple trading venues can list and trade the same product while contributing to—and drawing from—a shared clearing infrastructure. This not only increases available liquidity for traders but also fosters competition among trading venues, which can differentiate on user experience, fee models, or market access without fragmenting liquidity.\nIn effect, the AFP enables a unified, venue-agnostic marketplace for each product, transforming derivatives markets from isolated silos into an interoperable ecosystem.",

This ensures that traders can easily deposit collateral and start trading without requiring them to do the Margin Account contract deployment themselves.\nA Margin Account in the collateral asset of the product you will create as this is where clearing fees will be credited to. For more information on creating a Margin Account, see How to create and fund a margin account on the AFP\nRead through the documentation as understanding how products work in the AFP is crucial to creating a successful one in the first place!\n\n\n\nImportant notes\n\n\nSteps to Create a Product\n\nDecide on a timeseries that your product will trade. Ensure there is a reliable, undisputable source of truth for the timeseries that oracles will be able to use to report a final settlement value.\nConstruct the Product Specification\n\nPrepare a valid Product struct with all required fields. There is no one-size-fits-all set of parameters that can be specified as each product is unique.\nImportant: the same builder cannot create two products with the same symbol!\n\nRegister the Product\n\nCall the register function on ProductRegistry.sol, passing your constructed Product struct as calldata.\nThis can either be done through the SDK , or direct calls on-chain to the contract.\nEnsure your product is in a PENDING state, which indicates it has passed the on-chain validity checks. This can be done by the view function:\n\n\n\nSoliditySDK\n\n\n    function state(bytes32 productId) external view returns (ProductState)\n\n\ndef greet(name):\n    print(f\"Hello, {name}!\")\n\n\n\n\nEnsure your product is listed on at least one trading protocol. This will ensure that traders have a clear way to trade your product. Listing your product on a trading protocol is up to the discretion of the trading protocols themselves.\nOnce the startTime of your product is reached, its state will go LIVE and become tradeable.

    "text": "For every settled trade, the MAs making up the trade are charged a Fee, which comprises two parts: Trading Fee and Clearing Fee.\nTypically, when trading protocols and clearing houses are tightly integrated, traders pay a single, undifferentiated “trading fee.” This approach, however, obscures the distinct and important roles that trading protocols and clearing houses play in the trade lifecycle.\nWith the AFP, trade execution and clearing are decoupled, so trading and clearing fees are treated as separate concerns and charged independently. This separation gives Product Builders the flexibility to redistribute fees as they wish. For example, clearing fees could be used to incentivize trading protocols to list their products and bootstrap liquidity by redirecting a portion of the Clearing Fees as rebates. If such incentives are unnecessary, Clearing Fees can instead be accumulated on the Product Builder’s Margin Account.\nAt the same time, trading protocols have complete flexibility in how they implement trading fees. Whether through maker rebates, volume-based tiers, or any other fee structure, the AFP empowers venues to design and adapt their own fee regimes to best serve their markets and participants.",

If finalizeFsp() is called on or after Earliest FSP Resolution Time, the clearing system requests the FSV from the Oracle. The clearing system makes the request by calling the Oracle’s resolve method with Oracle FSV Call Data. Both FSV Call Data and the address of the Oracle are specified by the Product Builder at product registration time. If the clearing system’s request to the oracle fails, the process fails. finalizeFsp() can be called repeatedly at any point until the request succeeds.\nIf the request returns a FSV, the second step in Final Settlement Price Resolution is executed. The FSV is used by the clearing system to compute the FSP using a linear transformation:\nFSP = FSV * alpha + beta\n, where alpha and beta are product parameters specified by the product Builder at product registration time. When Oracle FSP Precision is &gt; Tick Size, it is important to note that truncation is applied to the FSP. Therefore, the least significant FSP digit might differ from what would be expected from the same transformation that rounded to Tick Size using floating point numbers.\nAn FSP check is performed such that if the calculated FSP &lt; 0, the resolution process fails. If FSP &gt;= 0, the product’s Mark Price is set to the FSP and the FSP is stored in the clearing system’s state for use in the Final Settlement Process.
