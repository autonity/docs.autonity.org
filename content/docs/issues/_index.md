  Known issues in the Autonity codebase

## Snap syncing is not supported for new networks

There is a known issue in the go-ethereum codebase where the default `snap` syncmode is not yet supported for new networks  - see https://github.com/autonity/autonity/blob/master/eth/handler.go#L196-L200.

To resolve, for new networks:

- genesis nodes bootstrapping the network need to run with full sync: set the flag `--syncmode "full"` when starting the node
- new nodes joining the network after genesis can run in the default "snap" syncmode.

## Autonity Protocol proposer election algorithm contains an off-by-one error

The proposer election algorithm for height `h` and round `r` actually returns the result for height `h-1` and round `r`.

The Autonity Protocol Contract Interface function [`getProposer()`](https://docs.autonity.org/reference/api/aut/#getproposer) takes parameters of block `height` and consensus `round`. To get the elected proposer for height = `h` and round = `r` pass the following parameters to it:
- height = `h - 1`.
- round = `r`.

## Tendermint Namespace Interface is accessible but not meant for use by external clients


Autonity has a Tendermint Interface used by the L1 Autonity Protocol and by the core development team as a development API. The Tendermint Namespace functions can be accessed from the Node JS Console and by RPC call but are not intended for use by external clients.

Access to the functions by RPC and Node JS Console will be deprecated and removed in a future Autonity Go Client Release.

## Autonity Liquid Newton Contract Interface functions `wal()` and `lsend()` show incorrect token symbol/name in terminal output

The Autonity Liquid Newton Contract Interface function [`wal()`](/reference/api/liquid-newton/#wal-_print-staking-wallet_) and [`lsend()`](/reference/api/liquid-newton/#lsend-_send-liquid-newton_) functions display "lnew" or "LNEW" in terminal output when they should display "lntn" or "LNTN":

- `wal()`: table column heading for the Liquid Newton amount held by the wallet shows "lnew" instead of "lntn".
- `lsend()`: shows a message sending "LNEW" instead of "LNTN".

The interface documentation shows the correct output in the [`wal()` example output](/reference/api/liquid-newton/#example-1) and [`lsend()` example output](/reference/api/liquid-newton/#example-4).
