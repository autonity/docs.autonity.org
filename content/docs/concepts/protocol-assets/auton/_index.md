  Auton - low-volatility utility coin
---

Auton is the [native coin](/glossary/#native-coin) of an account on an Autonity network. It is the protocol coin in which an [account](/glossary/#account) balance is denominated and is used by transaction senders for paying gas fees in the Autonity blockchain. Auton is divisible up to 18 decimal places (the smallest unit is 10^-18 or 0.000000000000000001). Its main characteristics are:

- Auton is the protocol's unit-of-account for pricing gas fees and all accounts must send auton with their transactions for paying gas fees.
- A stabilisation mechanism works to minimise the market volatility of the auton's exchange value vis-a-vis major fiat currencies, making auton a useful asset with which to compose other use-cases built on top of the Autonity blockchain.
