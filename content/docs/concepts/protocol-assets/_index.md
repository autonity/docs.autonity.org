  Protocol assets - Auton, Newton, and Liquid Newton
---

Autonity has two native coins: the _Auton_ and the _Newton_. Auton is the utility coin used by transaction senders for paying gas fees within the autonity protocol and newton is the coin used for staking the network. Autonity implements a liquid staking model and on staking newton to the network a validator-specific _Liquid Newton_ token is minted to the staker.
