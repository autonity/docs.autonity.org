## Overview

Autonity implements the Tendermint Proof of Stake consensus protocol for computing and agreeing state transitions. Key concepts of the consensus mechanism explained in this section are:

- Byzantine fault tolerant consensus algorithm providing finality for transactions and ledger integrity
- The role of the consensus committee on the Autonity network, dynamic committee selection, and the mechanism by which committee membership is computed.
