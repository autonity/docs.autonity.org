The steps in this section describe how to set up a local testnet for development and deploy contracts to your local or a public Autonity network.

It is assumed that you the reader have:

- [Setup the `aut` CLI](/account-holders/setup-autcli/) tool and have an [account](/account-holders/create-acct/). If you are deploying to a local testnet then your account is self-funded. Otherwise, if deploying to a public network you will need to [fund](/account-holders/fund-acct/) your account from the testnet faucet. See the [Account Holder](/account-holders/) guide for details of account setup and how to submit transactions using the `aut` CLI tool.
- An installation of the Autonity Go Client. See the [Running a node](/node-operators) guide for details of how to [install Autonity in your environment](/node-operators/install-aut/) and [run](/node-operators/run-aut/) it.
