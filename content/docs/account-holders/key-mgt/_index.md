Autonity provides secure account management and transaction signing using standard go-ethereum mechanisms:

- keystore files for private key encryption and storage
- [Clef](/account-holders/key-mgt//clef/) secure software wallet for key storage and transaction signing
- [Hardware wallets](/account-holders/key-mgt//usb-wallets) for key storage and transaction signing:
  - USB wallets: Trezor and Ledger
