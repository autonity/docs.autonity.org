    Start interacting with the Autonity network, create an account and fund it to issue simple transactions.

In order to submit a transaction to the Autonity network, an _account_ is required.  The concept of an _account_ in Autonity matches that of [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/accounts/).  Briefly, an account has a public _address_ (which acts as an identifier of the account for use by other participants) and a secret "private key", which is required in order to control the account (and in particular to spend funds held by the account).  This is described further in the [System Model section](/concepts/system-model/#accounts---eoa-and-contract)
