    Instructions for setting up and operating a validator node.
---

A node on the Autonity network can be registered to become a [Validator](/concepts/validator/), making it eligible for selection into the [consensus committee](/concepts/consensus/committee/) to earn rewards for proposing and finalizing blocks.

The steps here describe how to perform this registration, as well as other operations related to validator nodes.  This guide assumes a [running node and connected `aut` CLI tool](/node-operators/).
