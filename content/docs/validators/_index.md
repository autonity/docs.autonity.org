    Instructions for setting up and operating a validator node and oracle server.
---

A node on the Autonity network can be registered to become a [Validator](/concepts/validator/), making it eligible for selection into the [consensus committee](/concepts/consensus/committee/) to earn rewards for proposing and finalising blocks.

Validator nodes participate in the oracle protocol when members of the consensus committee. Accordingly, to operate a validator node, the Autonity Oracle Server must also be installed and configured to collect data from one or more external data sources.

The steps here describe how to register a node as a validator and other operations related to validator node management. This guide assumes a [running oracle server](/oracle/) and a [running node and connected `aut`](/node-operators/).
