    A guide to staking operations on the Autonity network.

Staking is the process of locking up _Newton_ tokens to help secure the network.  In return, the staker (or delegator) earns a proportion of the network transaction fees paid by users of the blockchain.  See the [Staking](/concepts/staking/) and [System model](/concepts/system-model/) sections of this documeent for further information about the role of staking in the Autonity network.

The steps in this section describe how to carry out operations related to staking.  It is assumed that you the reader has setup the `aut` CLI tool, has an [account](/account-holder/create-acct/) with [fund](/account-holder/fund-acct/) and is able to submit transactions to the network.  See the [Account Holder Guide](/account-holder/) for details.
