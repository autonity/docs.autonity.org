## Operator only

Functions with the `onlyOperator` access constraint that can only be called by the governance operator account.

###  burn

Burns the specified amount of Newton stake token from an account. When `x` amount of newton is burned, then `x` is simply deducted from the account’s balance and from the total supply of newton in circulation.

#### Parameters
   
| Field | Datatype | Description |
| --| --| --| 
| `_addr ` | `address` | the account address from which newton is being burned |
| `_amount ` | `uint256` | a positive integer value for the value amount being burned, denominated in Newton |

#### Response

No response object is returned on successful execution of the method call.

The new Newton balance of the account can be retrieved from state by calling the [`balanceOf()`](/reference/api/aut/#balanceof) method.

The new total supply of Newton in circulation can be retrieved from state by calling the [`totalSupply()`](/reference/api/aut/#totalsupply) method.

#### Event

On a successful call the function emits a `BurnedStake` event, logging: `_addr`, `_amount`.

###  mint (Supply Control Contract)

The Auton mint function, called by the Stabilization Contract to mint Auton to recipients while processing a CDP borrowing. 

The protocol calls the function using by the `stabilizer` account, the Stabilization Contract address
The recipient cannot be the `stabilizer` account or the `0` zero address. The minted `amount` cannot be equal to `0` or greater than the Supply Control Contract's available auton `balance`.
    
When `x` amount of auton is minted, then `x` is simply added to the account’s balance, increasing the total supply of Auton in circulation and reducing the supply of Auton available for minting.       
        
#### Parameters
   
| Field | Datatype | Description |
| --| --| --| 
| `recipient ` | `address` | the recipient account address |
| `amount ` | `uint256` | amount of Auton to mint (non-zero) |

#### Response

No response object is returned on successful execution of the method call.

The new Auton balance of the recipient account can be returned from state using `aut` to [Get the auton balance](/account-holders/submit-trans-aut/#get-auton-balance).

The new total supply of auton available for minting can be retrieved from state by calling the [`availableSupply()`](/reference/api/asm/supplycontrol/#availablesupply) method.

#### Event

On a successful call the function emits a `Mint` event, logging: `recipient`, `amount`.

## Protocol only

Functions with protocol contract access constraints can only be invoked by the Autonity protocol itself:

- Autonity Protocol Contract: for state finalization and committee selection
- Autonity Stabilization Contract: for Auton mint and burn.

###  burn (Supply Control Contract)

The Auton burn function, called by the Stabilization Contract `stabilizer` account address to burn Auton while processing a CDP repayment. 

Burns the specified amount of Auton, taking it out of circulation.

Constraint checks are applied:

- the caller is the `stabilizer` account, the Stabilization Contract address.

#### Parameters
   
| Field | Datatype | Description |
| --| --| --| 
| `amount ` | `uint256` | a non-zero integer value for the value amount being burned, denominated in Auton |

#### Response

No response object is returned on successful execution of the method call.

#### Event

On a successful call the function emits a `Burn` event, logging: `value`, the amount of Auton burned.


###  computeCommittee

Selects the consensus committee for the following epoch by selecting the validators with the highest amount of bonded stake.

The algorithm reads from the `validatorList`  state variable to select the set of registered validators that are in an `enabled` state and with bonded stake greater than `0`. 

If the number of selected validators exceeds the maximum committee size, then the selected validators are sorted by bonded stake amount in ascending order. The top `N` where `N` is the maximum committee size, are then selected to be members of the consensus committee for the next epoch.

The consensus committee variables maintained in persistent storage are deleted and recreated:

- `committee` is assigned the array of new `CommitteeMember`'s, each `CommitteeMember` struct recording the validator's account address (`_addr`) and bonded stake amount (`votingPower`)
- `committeeNodes` is assigned the array of enode URL's for the committee members
- `epochTotalBondedStake` is assigned the total amount of the stake bonded to the committee members.

Constraint checks:

- `validatorList.length > 0`. A committee cannot be selected without registered validators.
- `ValidatorState.enabled`. Validators must have a state of enabled to be included in the selection algorithm.
- `bondedStake > 0`. Validators must have a non-zero amount of bonded stake to be included in the selection algorithm.

#### Parameters

None.

#### Response

No response object is returned on successful execution of the method invocation.

The new committee can be retrieved from state by calling the [`getCommittee()`](/reference/api/aut/#getcommittee) method.

The new committee enode URL's can be retrieved from state by calling the [`getCommitteeEnodes()`](/reference/api/aut/#getcommitteeenodes) method.

Returns the amount of stake token bonded to the new consensus committee members and securing the network during the epoch can be retrieved from state by a call to the [`epochTotalBondedStake()`](/reference/api/aut/#epochtotalbondedstake) method.

### distributeRewards (Accountability Contract)

The Accountability Contract reward distribution function, called at epoch finalisation as part of the state finalisation function [`finalize`](/reference/api/aut/op-prot/#finalize). 

The function:

- distributes rewards for reporting provable faults committed by an offending validator to the reporting validator.
- if multiple slashing events are committed by the same offending validator during the same epoch, then rewards are only distributed to the last reporter.
- if funds can't be transferred to the reporter's `treasury` account, then rewards go to the autonity protocol `treasury` account for community funds (see also [Protocol Parameters](/reference/protocol/#parameters) Reference).

After distribution, the reporting validator is removed from the `beneficiaries` array.

#### Parameters

| Field | Datatype | Description |
| --| --| --|
| `_validator` | `address` | the address of the validator node being slashed |

#### Response

None.

#### Event

None.


###  finalize

The block finalisation function, invoked each block after processing every transaction within it. The function:

- tests if the `bytecode` protocol parameter is `0` length to determine if an Autonity Protocol Contract upgrade is available. If the `bytecode` length is `>0`, the `contractUpgradeReady` protocol parameter is set to `true`

- tests if the block number is the last epoch block number (equal to `lastEpochBlock + epochPeriod` config) and if so sets the `epochEnded` boolean variable to `true` or `false` accordingly
- invokes the Accountability Contract [`finalize()`](/reference/api/aut/op-prot/#finalize-accountability-contract) function, triggering the Accountability Contract to compute and apply penalties for provable accountability and omission faults committed by validators, and distribute rewards for submitting provable fault accusations
- then, if `epochEnded` is `true`:

    - performs the staking rewards redistribution, redistributing the available reward amount per protocol and emitting a `Rewarded` event for each distribution
    - applies any staking transitions - pending bonding and unbonding requests tracked in `BondingRequest` and `UnbondingRequest` data structures in memory
    - applies any validator commission rate changes - pending rate change requests tracked in `CommissionRateChangeRequest` data structures in memory
    - selects the consensus committee for the following epoch, invoking the [`computeCommittee()`](/reference/api/aut/op-prot/#computecommittee) function
    - assigns the `lastEpochBlock` state variable the value of the current block number
    - increments the `epochID` by `1`
    - emits a `NewEpoch` event logging the `epochID` of the new epoch
- invokes the Oracle Contract [`finalize()`](/reference/api/aut/op-prot/#finalize-oracle-contract) function, triggering the Oracle Contract to check it is the end of a voting round and if so:
  - calculate the median price of [currency pairs](/glossary/#currency-pair)
  - re-set oracle voters and parameters ready for the next oracle voting round.
- then, if the oracle has computed data and started a new voting round (`newRound` is `true`), invokes the ACU Contract [`update()`](/reference/api/aut/op-prot/#update-acu-contract) function to recompute the ACU value using the new price data.

#### Parameters

None.

#### Response

| Field | Datatype | Description |
| --| --| --| 
| `contractUpgradeReady` | `bool` | Set to `true` if an Autonity Protocol Contract upgrade is available |
| `committee`| `CommitteeMember[]` array | the consensus committee that approved the block, each `CommitteeMember` struct recording the validator's account address (`_addr`) and bonded stake amount (`votingPower`)|

{{% alert title="Note" %}}If a contract upgrade is available, this is executed by the protocol at epoch finalisation. After an upgrade has been completed the new Autonity Protocol Contract version can be retrieved from state by calling the [`getVersion()`](/reference/api/aut/#getversion) method.{{% /alert %}}

#### Event

On successful reward distribution the function emits:

- a `Rewarded` event for each staking reward distribution, logging: recipient address `addr` and reward amount `amount`.
- a `NewEpoch` event signalling the beginning of a new epoch, logging: unique identifier for the new epoch `epochID`.


###  finalize (Accountability Contract)

The Accountability Contract finalisation function, called at each block finalisation as part of the state finalisation function [`finalize()`](/reference/api/aut/op-prot/#finalize). The function checks if it is the last block of the epoch, then:

- On each block, tries to [promote `Accusations`](/reference/api/aut/op-prot/#promote-guilty-accusations) without proof of innocence into misconducts. `Accusations` without a valid innocence proof are considered guilty of the reported misconduct and a new fault proof is created if the fault severity is higher than that of any previous fault already committed by the validator in the current epoch.

{{% alert title="Note" %}}
A validator can, of course, have more than one fault proven against it in an epoch. For example, a first fault is proven and then another fault for a higher severity is proven. Note that the protocol will only apply an accountability slashing to a validator for the fault with the highest severity committed in an epoch.
{{% /alert %}}

- On epoch end, [performs slashing tasks](/reference/api/aut/op-prot/#perform-slashing-tasks).

#### promote guilty accusations

`Accusations` are placed into an `accusation` queue stored in memory. For each `Accusation` in the queue, the protocol checks if the proof submission window for the `Accusation` has expired and, if so, it attempts to promote the `Accusation` into a misbehaviour fault. If a fault with a higher severity than the `Accusation` already exists for the epoch, then the `Accusation` is dropped. Otherwise, a new `FaultProof` is created from the `Accusation` and the slashing history of the validator is updated to record this as the highest severity fault committed in the epoch.

The function takes each `Accusation` proof from the accusations queue and:

- Checks if the proof innocence window has closed. If the window is still open, the `Accusation`  remains in the queue. If the window has closed (the sum of the block number at which the `Accusation` was reported and the number of blocks in the proof innocence window is greater than the current block number (`_ev.reportingBlock + INNOCENCE_PROOF_SUBMISSION_WINDOW > block.number`)), then the `Accusation` is removed from the queue (i.e. deleted) to determine if the `Accusation's` should be promoted to a fault.
- Tries to promote the `Accusation` to a fault or discards. The slashing history of the validator is checked to see if the validator already has a proven offence (i.e. a `FaultProof`) for the epoch with a severity `>=` to the `Accusation`. If true, then the `Accusation` is skipped as a `FaultProof` with a higher severity has already been reported during the epoch. If false, then the validator's slashing history is updated to record the new fault as the highest severity for the epoch. A new `FaultProof` is created for the validator and added to the slashing queue.
- A `FaultProof` event is emitted logging the event.

The reported validator will be silenced and slashed for the fault at the end of the current epoch.

#### perform slashing tasks

For each fault the protocol performs slashing over faulty validators at the end of an epoch.

The function checks the total number of faults committed by **all**  validators in the epoch, counting the number of fault proofs in the slashing queue, to quantify validator collusion. It then applies slashing for each fault in the slashing queue:

- Computes the slashing. The slashing rate and amount are computed taking into account the number of fault offences committed in the epoch by the offending validator and all validators globally. The slashing amount is calculated by the formula `(slashing rate * validator bonded stake)/slashing rate precision`.
- Applies the slashing penalty. Slashing is applied to the offending validator's stake, subtracting the slashing amount from the validator's bonded stake according to the protocol's [Penalty Absorbing Stake (PAS)](/concepts/accountability/#penalty-absorbing-stake-pas) model ([self-bonded](/glossary/#self-bonded) stake before [delegated](/glossary/#delegated) stake)
- Computes the jail period of the offending validator. The jail period is calculated by the formula `current block number + jail factor * proven offence fault count * epoch period`, and sets the validator's jail release block number. The validator state is set to `jailed`. 
- Updates validator history and bonded stake amounts. The validator's proven fault counter is incremented by `1` to record the slashing occurrence in the validator's reputational slashing history. Bonded stake amounts are adjusted for the slashing amount and the slashed stake token are transferred to the Autonity Protocol global `treasury` account for community funding.
- Updates global slashing state. The pending slashing fault queue is reset ready for the next epoch, and the reporting validator is added to the array of reward beneficiaries that will receive rewards for offence reporting
- A `SlashingEvent` event is emitted for each validator that has been slashed.

Rewards for fault reporting are distributed to the `treasury` account of the reporting validator as the last block of the epoch is finalised. Reporting validator [self-bonded](/glossary/#self-bonded) and [delegated](/glossary/#delegated) stakeholders receive a share of the rewards _pro rata_ to their bonded stake amount. If the rewards transfer to the validator `treasury` account fails, then the rewards are sent to the Autonity Protocol's community `treasury` account.

{{% alert title="Note" %}}
The protocol adjusts the slashing rate according to the total number of fault offences committed in an epoch across all validators.

This mechanism applies a dynamic slashing rate mitigating collusion risk by Byzantine agents in an epoch.
{{% /alert %}}    

#### Parameters

| Field | Datatype | Description |
| --| --| --| 
| `epochEnd` | `Bool` | boolean value indicating if the current block is the last block of the epoch (`true`) or not (`false`) |

#### Response

None.

#### Event

The function emits events:

- on submission of a fault proof, a `NewFaultProof` event, logging: `_offender`, `_severity`, `_id`.
- after a successful slashing, a `SlashingEvent` logging: `_val.nodeAddress`, `_slashingAmount`, `_val.jailReleaseBlock`.


###  finalize (Oracle Contract)

The Oracle Contract finalisation function, called once per `VotePeriod` as part of the state finalisation function [`finalize()`](/reference/api/aut/op-prot/#finalize). The function checks if it is the last block of the vote period, if so then:

- executes the Oracle Contract's on-chain aggregation routine to calculate the median of all price data points for each symbol submitted to the oracle, invoking the Oracle Contract `aggregateSymbol` function
- checks if there have been any oracle voter changes, if so then updates the oracle voter set for the following oracle voting round
- resets the `lastRoundBlock` to the current `block.number`
- increments the `round` counter by `1`
- checks if there have been any oracle symbol changes, if so then updates the oracle symbol set for the following oracle voting round.

#### Parameters

None.

#### Response

Returns `true` if there is a new voting round and new symbol prices are available, `false` if not.

#### Event

On success the function emits a `NewRound` event for the new oracle voting period, logging: round number `round`, `block.number`, `block.timestamp` and vote period duration `votePeriod`.


### handleEvent (Accountability Contract)

The accountability event handling function, invoked by protocol on submission of accountability event data to handle event processing.

Constraint checks are applied:
 
 - the `msg.sender` caller is a registered [validator identifier](/concepts/validator/#validator-identifier), else the transaction reverts. (Rewards for reporting a successful slashing event are distributed to the validator's [`treasury` account](/concepts/validator/#treasury-account).)
 - the `msg.sender` calling the function and the slashing event reporter addresses are the same.
 - chunk segments are contiguous for oversize events that have been chunked for storage into a map. If an event's raw proof data is above a floor byte size, then the event is `chunked` into `16kb` size chunks and stored in a map. Chunk id's must be contiguous; i.e. a map can only contain chunks from one and not multiple events.

The function checks the event data:

- If the raw proof contains `>1` chunk, then the function stores the event into a map and then returns.

The function then processes the event according to event type.

The function validates the accountability event proof, passing the event's `rawProof` data to a precompiled contract for verification. The precompiled contract returns verification outcome to the method:

- `_success` - boolean flag indicating if proof verification succeeded or failed
- `_offender` - validator identifier address of the fault offender
- `_ruleId` - ID of the accountability rule tested
- `_block` - number of the block in which the fault occurred
- `_messageHash` - cryptographic hash of the main fault evidence, the `rawProof`.

Based on the verification outcome, constraint checks are applied:

- the raw proof verification passed: `_success` is `true`
- there are no mismatches between the event data and the verified raw proof data fields:
  - the returned `_offender` and event `offender` address values match
  - the returned `_ruleId` and event `rule` identifier values match
- the`_block` number returned by the verification is less than the current `block.number` - the proof is for a historical and not future event

- depending on event type, specific constraint checks are applied:

  - if `FaultProof`, then:
    - the severity of the fault event is greater than the severity of the offender's current slashing history for the epoch.

  - if `Accusation`, then:
    - the severity of the fault event is greater than the severity of the offender's current slashing history for the epoch
    <!-- - the validator has not already been slashed for a fault with a higher severity in the proof's epoch. -->
    - the validator does not have a pending accusation being processed.

  - if `InnocenceProof`, then:
    - the validator has an associated pending accusation being processed
    - the innocence proof and associated accusation proof have matching: rule identifiers, block number, message hash.

On successful constraint checking:

- The `event` data object is updated using data returned by processing of the raw proof during proof verification processing:

| Field | Datatype | Description |
| --| --| --|
| `block ` | `uint256` | assigned block number returned from verification in `_block`|
| `epoch` | `uint256` | assigned the identifier of the epoch in which the accountability event `_block` occurred |
| `reportingBlock` | `uint256` | assigned the current block number |
| `messageHash` | `uint256` | assigned the hash of the main evidence for the accountability event returned from verification in `_messageHash` |

- The event is added to the events queue and assigned an `_eventId` value reflecting its position in the event queue.

Then, depending on event type:

- If `FaultProof`, then:
  - The record of validator faults is updated to add the new event ID.
  - The event is added to the slashing queue.
  - The slashing history of the validator for the epoch is updated to record the fault's severity.

- If `Accusation`, then:
  - The event is recorded as the validator's pending accusation.
  - The event is added to the accusation queue.

- If `InnocenceProof`, then:
  - The accusation queue is checked and the associated accusation is removed.
  - The validator's pending accusation is reset to `0`, indicating the validator has no pending accusations (so a new accusation can now be submitted against the validator).


#### Parameters

| Field | Datatype | Description |
| --| --| --|
| `_event` | `Event` | event data object |

On proof submission an `_event` object data structure is constructed in memory, populated with fields ready for proof processing:

- Fault proof: a `NewFaultProof` event, logging: round `_offender` validator address, `_severity` of the fault, and `_eventId`.
- Accusation proof: a `NewAccusation` event, logging: round `_offender` validator address, `_severity` of the fault, and `_eventId`.
- Innocence proof: an `InnocenceProven` event, logging: `_offender` validator address, `0` indicating there are no pending accusations against the validator.


###  mint (Supply Control Contract)

The Auton mint function, called by the Stabilization Contract to mint Auton to recipients while processing a CDP borrowing. 

Mints Auton and sends it to a recipient account, increasing the amount of Auton in circulation. 

Constraint checks are applied:

- the caller is the `stabilizer` account, the Stabilization Contract address
- invalid recipient: the `recipient` cannot be the `stabilizer` account, the Stabilization Contract address, or the `0` zero address
- invalid amount: the `amount` is not equal to `0` or greater than the Supply Control Contract's available Auton `balance`.
    
When `x` amount of Auton is minted, then `x` is simply added to the account’s balance, increasing the total supply of Auton in circulation and reducing the supply of Auton available for minting.       
        
#### Parameters
   
| Field | Datatype | Description |
| --| --| --| 
| `recipient ` | `address` | the recipient account address |
| `amount ` | `uint256` | amount of Auton to mint (non-zero) |

#### Response

No response object is returned on successful execution of the method call.

The new Auton balance of the recipient account can be returned from state using `aut` to [Get the auton balance](/account-holders/submit-trans-aut/#get-auton-balance).

The new total supply of auton available for minting can be retrieved from state by calling the [`availableSupply()`](/reference/api/asm/supplycontrol/#availablesupply) method.

#### Event

On a successful call the function emits a `Mint` event, logging: `recipient`, `amount`.


###  update (ACU Contract)

The Auton Currency Unit (ACU) Contract finalization function, called once per Oracle voting round as part of the state finalization function [`finalize()`](/reference/api/aut/op-prot/#finalize). The function checks if the Oracle Contract [`finalize()`](/reference/api/aut/op-prot/#finalize-oracle-contract) has initiated a new oracle voting round, if so then:

- it retrieves the latest prices from the Oracle Contract (i.e. the latest round data)
- checks price data completeness:
  - if latest prices have been returned for all symbols in the ACU currency basket, then:
    - computes the ACU index value
    - resets the `round` to the index number of the oracle voting round that computed the retrieved latest prices.
    - returns status of `true` to the calling Autonity Protocol Contract
  - else if one or more prices are unavailable from the Oracle, it will not compute the ACU value for that round, and returns status of `false` to the calling Autonity Protocol Contract.

#### Parameters

None.

#### Response

None.

#### Event

On success the function emits an `Updated` event for the new ACU value, logging: `block.number`, `block.timestamp`, oracle voting round number `round`, and the ACU index value calculated `_value`.
