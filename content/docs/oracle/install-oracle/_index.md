  How to install an Autonity Oracle Server on your host machine.
---

## Overview

The Autonity Oracle Server can be installed in several ways:

- as a pre-compiled Linux Executable File from the Release Archive
- by building the client from source code
- in a Docker container.

We assume that the Autonity Oracle Server will run on a _host_ machine (a VPS or other host that is always-on and persistently available), and a distinct _host_ machine will be used for Autonity Go Client the oracle serves via the WSS endpoint.

{{< alert title="Note" >}}
Autonity Oracle Server source code is versioned on a 3-digit `major.minor.patch` versioning scheme, and hosted and maintained in the public GitHub repo [autonity-oracle <i class='fas fa-external-link-alt'></i>] (https://github.com/autonity/autonity-oracle).

## Requirements

### Hardware

To run an Autonity Oracle Server, we recommend using a host machine (physical or virtual) with the following _minimum_ specification:

| Requirement	 | At least | Recommended|
|-------------|----------|------------|
| OS | Ubuntu 20.04 LTS | Ubuntu 20.04 LTS |
| CPU |1.9GHz with 4CPU's |  1.9GHz with 4CPU's |
| RAM |2GB |  4GB |
| Storage |32GB |  64GB |
| Network interface	| 64Mbit/s |  128Mbit/s |

### Network

A public-facing internet connection with static IP is required.  Incoming traffic must be allowed on the following:

* `TCP 8546` to make WebSocket RPC connections to the node.

{{< alert title="Note" >}}

Your validator node's [installation](/node-operators/install-aut/#network) must also allow traffic on your validator node's port `TCP 8546` to allow the Oracle Server's WebSocket RPC connection to the node.
{{< /alert >}}

The description here covers only the basic network setup. Especially in a production setting, administrators should consider further security measures based on their situation.

## Installing the pre-compiled executable {#install-binary}

{{< alert title="Note" >}}
  A Linux OS running on AMD64 architecture is required to run the pre-compiled executable.
{{< /alert >}}

1. Navigate to the Autonity Oracle Server [Releases <i class='fas fa-external-link-alt'></i>](https://github.com/autonity/autonity-oracle/releases) Archive and download the latest stable release version of the Autonity Oracle Server `autoracle-linux-amd64-<RELEASE_VERSION>.tar.gz` from the Assets section.

2. Create a working directory for installing Oracle Server. For example:

    ```bash
    mkdir autonity-oracle
    cd autonity-oracle
    ```

3. Unpack the downloaded _tarball_ to your working directory:

    ```bash
    tar -xf <PATH_TO_DOWNLOADS_DIRECTORY>/autoracle-linux-amd64-<RELEASE_VERSION>.tar.gz
    ```
    This will unpack the pre-compiled executable, a `/plugins` subdirectory containing data source plugins packaged in the release, and a `plugins-conf.yml` configuration file.

4. (Optional) Add data source plugins. Navigate to the `plugins` sub-directory of your working directory and add sub-directories for additional plugins you are installing.

5. (Optional) Copy the binary to `/usr/local/bin` so it can be accessed by all users, or other location in your `PATH` :

    ```bash
    sudo cp -r autoracle /usr/local/bin/autoracle
    ```

{{% pageinfo %}}
You can now [configure and launch Autonity Oracle Server](/oracle/run-oracle/#run-binary).

## Build from source code {#install-source}

{{< alert title="Prerequisites" >}}
The following should be installed in order to build the Autonity Oracle Server:
- **Git** Follow the official GitHub documentation to [install git <i class='fas fa-external-link-alt'></i>](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git). (Check if installed:  `git --version`)
- **Golang** (version 1.19.3 or later) - [https://golang.org/dl <i class='fas fa-external-link-alt'></i>](https://golang.org/dl) (Check if installed:  `go --version` or `go version`)
- **C compiler** (GCC or another) (Check if GCC is installed:  `gcc --version`)
- [**GNU Make** <i class='fas fa-external-link-alt'></i>](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) (Check if installed:  `make --version`)
{{< /alert >}}


1. Clone/Copy the Autonity Oracle Server repo:

    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:autonity/autonity-oracle.git
    ```

2. Enter the `autonity-oracle` directory and build autonity oracle server:

    ```bash
    cd autonity-oracle
    make autoracle
    ```
    
    This will build the executable (`./build/bin/autoracle`) and create a subdirectory containing data source plugins packaged in the release (`./build/bin/plugins/`).

4. (Optional) Add data source plugins. Navigate to the `plugins` sub-directory of your working directory and add sub-directories for additional plugins you are installing. See [Installing data source plugins](/oracle/install-oracle/#install-plugin).

5. (Optional) Copy the generated binary to `/usr/local/bin` so it can be accessed by all users, or other location in your `PATH`:

    ```bash
    sudo cp build/bin/autoracle /usr/local/bin/autoracle
    ```

## Installing the Docker image {#install-docker}

{{< alert title="Note" >}}
Follow the official Docker documentation to [install Docker <i class='fas fa-external-link-alt'></i>](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) onto the host machine and [follow the post-installation steps <i class='fas fa-external-link-alt'></i>](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/) to customize for your environment.

By default Docker needs to be run with `sudo`. To avoid using root privileges in the terminal (and error messages if you forget to use `sudo`), consider following the step to [Manage Docker as a non-root user <i class='fas fa-external-link-alt'></i>](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/#manage-docker-as-a-non-root-user).

Consider also [configuring Docker to start on boot <i class='fas fa-external-link-alt'></i>](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/#configure-docker-to-start-on-boot).
{{< /alert >}}

{{< alert title="Optional but recommended" >}}

To limit the size of the log files, add the following to the file `/etc/docker/daemon.json` (create it if it does not exist):

```json
{
  "log-driver": "json-file",
  "log-opts": {
    "max-size": "500m",
    "max-file": "20"
  }
}
```

Restart the Docker service to ensure the change is reflected:

``` bash
sudo systemctl restart docker
```
{{< /alert >}}

1. Create a working directory and CD to your working directory:
    ```bash
    mkdir autonity-oracle && cd autonity-oracle
    ```
   
2. Pull the Autonity Oracle Server image from the GitHub Container Registry.
   
   If you are deploying to the Bakerloo Testnet:
   
    ```bash
    docker pull ghcr.io/autonity/autonity-oracle-bakerloo:latest
    ```
   
   If you are deploying to the Piccadilly Testnet:
   
    ```bash
    docker pull ghcr.io/autonity/autonity-oracle-piccadilly:latest
    ```

   (where `latest` can be replaced with another version)
   
   Note that the data source plugins are included as part of the Docker image at the directory path `/usr/local/bin/plugins`.

   {{< alert title="Note" >}}
   For more information on using and pulling Docker images from GHCR, see GitHub docs [Working with the container registry <i class='fas fa-external-link-alt'></i>](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-container-registry).
   {{< /alert >}}

<!-- TODO: UPDATE to autonity-oracle:latest

3. Verify the authenticity of the Autonity Oracle Server Docker images against the official [image digests <i class='fas fa-external-link-alt'></i>](https://github.com/autonity/autonity-oracle/pkgs/container/autonity-oracle/versions):

    ```bash
    docker images --digests ghcr.io/autonity/autonity-oracle
    REPOSITORY                               TAG       DIGEST                                                                    IMAGE ID       CREATED        SIZE

GOROOT=/usr/local/go
```
-->

(Optional) Add data source plugins. Navigate to the plugins sub-directory of your working directory and add sub-directories for additional plugins you are installing.

{{% pageinfo %}}
You can now [configure and launch oracle server](/oracle/run-oracle/#run-docker).
{{% /pageinfo %}}


## Verify the installation {#verify}

You should now be able to execute the `autoracle` command.  Verify your installation by executing `autoracle version` to return the oracle version and configuration:

```bash
$ ./autoracle version
```
```
v0.1.4
```

{{< alert title="Note" >}}
The output above will vary depending on the version of the Autonity Oracle Server you have installed.  Confirm that the "Version" field is consistent with the version you expect.
{{< /alert >}}

## Installing data source plugins {#install-plugin}

Oracle server will need to provide price data for FX and ATN and NTN currency pairs utilized in the Auton Stabilization Mechanism.

A basic set of data adaptor plugins for sourcing this data is provided out the box with oracle server for testnet pre-Mainnet:

- Forex plugins: for connecting to public FX data sources. See the `forex_` prefixed adaptors in [`/plugins`<i class='fas fa-external-link-alt'></i>](https://github.com/autonity/autonity-oracle/tree/master/plugins). Four forex plugins are currently provided.
- Simulator plugin: for simulated ATN and NTN data. You need to install and run this plugin if you are deploying to Bakerloo Testnet, or for your own local testnet purposes. See the `simulator_plugin` adaptor in [`/plugins`<i class='fas fa-external-link-alt'></i>](https://github.com/autonity/autonity-oracle/tree/master/plugins). 

The plugins are built by the `make` process when building from source. The plugins are included pre-built as part of oracle server Docker image and the pre-built executable.

If installing by building from source, you will also need to build and install the Simulator plugin if you want to use it for Bakerloo Testnet or your own local testnet:

1. Run `make simulator`.

This will build the `simulator_plugin` in the `/plugins` directory.

The FX plugins in the `/plugins` directory are built when running `make autoracle`.

{{% alert title="Note"%}}
If you have developed your own plugins for external data sources using the oracle server's plugin template architecture, then you will need to build them and add to the `/plugins` directory.

For how to do this, see [Developing data plugins](/concepts/oracle-network/#developing-data-plugins).
