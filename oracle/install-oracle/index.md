  How to install an Autonity Oracle Server on your host machine.
---

## Overview

The [Autonity Oracle Server ](https://github.com/autonity/autonity-oracle) can be installed in several ways:

- as a pre-compiled Linux Executable File from the Release Archive
- by building the server from source code
- in a Docker container.

We assume that the Autonity Oracle Server will run on a _host_ machine (a VPS or other host that is always-on and persistently available), and a distinct _host_ machine will be used for Autonity Go Client the oracle serves via the WSS endpoint.

::: {.callout-note title="Note" collapse="false"}
Autonity Oracle Server source code is versioned on a 3-digit `major.minor.patch` versioning scheme, and hosted and maintained in the public GitHub repo [autonity-oracle](https://github.com/autonity/autonity-oracle).

Before installing verify the correct Autonity Oracle Server release version to use for the network you are connecting to. See the [Networks](/networks/) pages [Bakerloo Testnet, Release](/networks/testnet-bakerloo/#release) and [Piccadilly Testnet, Release](/networks/testnet-piccadilly/#release) for the versions deployed.

## Requirements

### Hardware

To run an Autonity Oracle Server, we recommend using a host machine (physical or virtual) with the following _minimum_ specification:

| Requirement	 | At least | Recommended|
|-------------|----------|------------|
| OS | Ubuntu 20.04 LTS | Ubuntu 20.04 LTS |
| CPU |1.9GHz with 4CPU's |  1.9GHz with 4CPU's |
| RAM |2GB |  4GB |
| Storage |32GB |  64GB |
| Network interface	| 64Mbit/s |  128Mbit/s |

### Network

A public-facing internet connection with static IP is required.  Incoming traffic must be allowed on the following:

* `TCP 8546` to make WebSocket RPC connections to the node.

::: {.callout-note title="Note" collapse="false"}

Your validator node's [installation](/node-operators/install-aut/#network) must also allow traffic on your validator node's port `TCP 8546` to allow the Oracle Server's WebSocket RPC connection to the node.
:::

The description here covers only the basic network setup. Especially in a production setting, administrators should consider further security measures based on their situation.

## Installing the pre-compiled executable {#install-binary}

::: {.callout-note title="Note" collapse="false"}
  A Linux OS running on AMD64 architecture is required to run the pre-compiled executable.
:::

1. Navigate to the Autonity Oracle Server [Releases](https://github.com/autonity/autonity-oracle/releases) Archive and download the latest stable release version of the Autonity Oracle Server `autoracle-linux-amd64-<RELEASE_VERSION>.tar.gz` from the Assets section.

2. Create a working directory for installing Oracle Server. For example:

    ```bash
    mkdir autonity-oracle
    cd autonity-oracle
    ```

3. Unpack the downloaded _tarball_ to your working directory:

    ```bash
    tar -xf <PATH_TO_DOWNLOADS_DIRECTORY>/autoracle-linux-amd64-<RELEASE_VERSION>.tar.gz
    ```
    This will unpack the pre-compiled executable, a `/plugins` subdirectory containing data source plugins packaged in the release, and a `plugins-conf.yml` configuration file.

4. (Optional) Add data source plugins. Navigate to the `plugins` sub-directory of your working directory and add sub-directories for additional plugins you are installing.

5. (Optional) Copy the binary to `/usr/local/bin` so it can be accessed by all users, or other location in your `PATH` :

    ```bash
    sudo cp -r autoracle /usr/local/bin/autoracle
    ```

::: {.callout-note title="Info" collapse="false"}
You can now [configure and launch Autonity Oracle Server](/oracle/run-oracle/#run-binary).
:::


## Build from source code {#install-source}

::: {.callout-note title="Prerequisites" collapse="false"}
The following should be installed in order to build the Autonity Oracle Server:

- **Git** Follow the official GitHub documentation to [install git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git). (Check if installed:  `git --version`)
- **Golang** (version 1.21 or later) - [https://golang.org/dl](https://golang.org/dl) (Check if installed:  `go --version` or `go version`)
- **C compiler** (GCC or another) (Check if GCC is installed:  `gcc --version`)
- [**GNU Make**](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) (Check if installed:  `make --version`)
:::


1. Clone/Copy the Autonity Oracle Server repo:

    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:autonity/autonity-oracle.git
    ```

2. Enter the `autonity-oracle` directory and build autonity oracle server.     ```
    
    This will build the executable (`./build/bin/autoracle`) and create a subdirectory containing data source plugins packaged in the release (`./build/bin/plugins/`).


    Adjust the `make` command according to the testnet you are connecting to.

    If connecting to Piccadilly Testnet, run:
    
    ```bash
    cd autonity-oracle
    make autoracle
    ```
    
    If connecting to Bakerloo Testnet, run:
    
    ```bash
    cd autonity-oracle
    make autoracle-bakerloo
    ```
    
4. (Optional) Add data source plugins. Navigate to the `plugins` sub-directory of your working directory and add sub-directories for additional plugins you are installing. See [Installing data source plugins](/oracle/install-oracle/#install-plugin).

5. (Optional) Copy the generated binary to `/usr/local/bin` so it can be accessed by all users, or other location in your `PATH`:

    ```bash
    sudo cp build/bin/autoracle /usr/local/bin/autoracle
    ```

::: {.callout-note title="Info" collapse="false"}
You can now [configure and launch Autonity Oracle Server](/oracle/run-oracle/#run-binary).
:::

## Installing the Docker image {#install-docker}

::: {.callout-note title="Note" collapse="false"}
Follow the official Docker documentation to [install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) onto the host machine and [follow the post-installation steps](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/) to customize for your environment.

By default Docker needs to be run with `sudo`. To avoid using root privileges in the terminal (and error messages if you forget to use `sudo`), consider following the step to [Manage Docker as a non-root user](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/#manage-docker-as-a-non-root-user).

Consider also [configuring Docker to start on boot](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/#configure-docker-to-start-on-boot).
:::

::: {.callout-note title="Optional but recommended" collapse="false"}
To limit the size of the log files, add the following to the file `/etc/docker/daemon.json` (create it if it does not exist):

```json
{
  "log-driver": "json-file",
  "log-opts": {
    "max-size": "500m",
    "max-file": "20"
  }
}
```

Restart the Docker service to ensure the change is reflected:

``` bash
sudo systemctl restart docker
```
:::

1. Create a working directory and CD to your working directory:
    
    ```bash
    mkdir autonity-oracle && cd autonity-oracle
    ```
   
2. Pull the Autonity Oracle Server image from the GitHub Container Registry.
   
   If you are deploying to the Bakerloo Testnet:
   
    ```bash
    docker pull ghcr.io/autonity/autonity-oracle-bakerloo:latest
    ```
   
   If you are deploying to the Piccadilly Testnet:
   
    ```bash
    docker pull ghcr.io/autonity/autonity-oracle-piccadilly:latest
    ```

   (where `latest` can be replaced with another version)

   ::: {.callout-note title="Note" collapse="false"}
   For more information on using and pulling Docker images from GHCR, see GitHub docs [Working with the container registry](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-container-registry).
   :::

3. Verify the authenticity of the Autonity Oracle Server Docker images against the official [image digests](https://github.com/autonity/autonity-oracle/pkgs/container/autonity-oracle/versions):


   If you are deploying to the Bakerloo Testnet:
   
    ```bash
    docker images --digests ghcr.io/autonity/autonity-oracle-bakerloo
    REPOSITORY                                  TAG       DIGEST                                                                    IMAGE ID       CREATED       SIZE
    ghcr.io/autonity/autonity-oracle-bakerloo   latest    sha256:f37cdf332bab761426f94a6b6f8e670efc7b95e4470bc9a4ce1151d48baff791   d6cc39e078f6   2 weeks ago   111MB
    ```
   
   If you are deploying to the Piccadilly Testnet:
   
    ```bash
    docker images --digests ghcr.io/autonity/autonity-oracle-piccadilly
    REPOSITORY                                    TAG       DIGEST                                                                    IMAGE ID       CREATED        SIZE
    ghcr.io/autonity/autonity-oracle-piccadilly   latest    sha256:aa0192ce1d72b1a6d5ad971e8d10a8dbc32004f4ea1d3da7217b80ec8b6a363e   78446bd6c4b6   2 weeks ago    111MB
    ```

4. Data source plugins. Note that the data source plugins are included as part of the Docker image at the directory path `/usr/local/bin/plugins`.

::: {.callout-note title="Info" collapse="false"}
You can now [configure and launch oracle server](/oracle/run-oracle/#run-docker).
:::


## Verify the installation {#verify}

You should now be able to execute the `autoracle` command.  Verify your installation by executing `autoracle version` to return the oracle version and configuration:

```bash
$ ./build/bin/autoracle version
```
```
v0.1.9
```

If using Docker, the setup of the Piccadilly Testnet image can be verified with:

```bash
docker run --rm ghcr.io/autonity/autonity-oracle-piccadilly:latest version 
```
```
v0.1.9
```

::: {.callout-note title="Note" collapse="false"}
The output above will vary depending on the version of the Autonity Oracle Server you have installed.  Confirm that the "Version" field is consistent with the version you expect.
:::

## Installing data source plugins {#install-plugin}

Oracle server will need to provide price data for FX and ATN and NTN currency pairs utilized in the Auton Stabilization Mechanism.

A basic set of data adaptor plugins for sourcing this data is provided out the box with oracle server for testnet pre-Mainnet:

- Forex plugins: for connecting to public FX data sources. See the `forex_` prefixed adaptors in [`/plugins`](https://github.com/autonity/autonity-oracle/tree/master/plugins). Four forex plugins are currently provided.
- ATN and NTN plugins:
  - For connecting to Piccadilly Testnet. See the `pcgc_cax` adaptor in [`/plugins`](https://github.com/autonity/autonity-oracle/tree/master/plugins). This provides ATN and NTN data from the Centralized Auton Exchange deployed to Piccadilly for the Piccadilly Circus Games Competition. See [game.autonity.org](https:game.autonity.org).
  - For connecting to Bakerloo Testnet. See the `sim_plugin` adaptor in [`/plugins`](https://github.com/autonity/autonity-oracle/tree/master/plugins/simulator_plugin). This provides simulated ATN and NTN data.


**These out the box plugins are built and included by default according to the installation method and Autonity testnet chosen.** They are:

- Built by the `make` process when building from source. Run the make command appropriate for the Testnet you are connecting to as described in [Build from source code](/oracle/install-oracle/#install-source). You can view the built plugins in the directory `./build/bin/plugins`.

- Included pre-built as part of the pre-built executable.  You can view the built plugins in the directory `/plugins`. The executable is built for Piccadilly Testnet only.

- Included pre-built as part of oracle server Docker image and the pre-built executable. Install the Docker image for the Testnet you are connecting to as described in [Installing the Docker image](/oracle/install-oracle/#install-docker). The built plugins are included in the Docker container at the path `/usr/local/bin/plugins`.

::: {.callout-note title="Note" collapse="false"}
The Simulator plugin for simulated ATN and NTN price data is built when building from source for Bakerloo Testnet. You can also build the Simulator plugin independently by running the command `make simulator`. This will build the `sim_plugin` in the `/plugins` directory. A local testnet could be a scenario for setting up and using a simulator.

If you have developed your own plugins for external data sources using the oracle server's plugin template architecture, then you will need to build them and add to the `/plugins` directory.

For how to do this, see [Developing data plugins](/concepts/oracle-server/#developing-data-plugins).
