The steps here describe interactions with the CDP-based [Auton Stabilization Mechanism (ASM)](/concepts/asm/) for:

- CDP owners to [open and manage a CDP](/cdp/open-cdp/) to borrow Auton having deposited collateral token
- CDP liquidators to identify and [liquidate a CDP](/cdp/liquidate-cdp/) in a liquidatable state.
