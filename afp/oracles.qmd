- [Oracle Interface](oracle-interface.qmd)

Autonity exposes a uniform oracle interface that third parties can seamlessly integrate with. It is up to the product builder to define which oracle to source the underlying data from for a particular product. This allows Autonity to be oracle agnostic.

However, initial reference implementations will be of the optimistic oracle type. This strategy works because the initial suite of products that will be released will be Dated Futures, which require a single final settlement price to be submitted to settle the product at expiry.
